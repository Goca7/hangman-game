## Features

### Index Page

The index page of the Hangman Game serves as the entry point to the game. It includes the following features:

- **Start Game Button**: 
  - Positioned at the top center of the page, this button is the main call-to-action, allowing users to start the game. Once clicked, it triggers the setup of the game and prepares the game area for user interaction.

- **Gallows Display**:
  - A visual representation of the gallows is prominently displayed on the page. This will serve as the base where the hangman figure appears as incorrect guesses are made during the game. The gallows consist of a vertical pole, a horizontal beam, and a rope where the hangman figure will be "hung."

  - The page features a clean and minimalistic design with ample white space, focusing the user's attention on the game elements. This simplicity helps in reducing distractions and enhances the user's gaming experience.

- **Interactive Elements**:
  - The start button is the only interactive element on the page before the game begins, providing a clear and straightforward user experience.

This index page sets the stage for the game, focusing on a simple, clean design that centers around the gameâ€™s core interactive elements.

2. As a player, I want to be able to guess a letter, and the game should tell me if it appears in the word or not, so that I can try to guess the word.

3. As a player, I want to win the game when I correctly guess the word, so that I can feel a sense of accomplishment.

4. As a player, I want to lose the game when I run out of guesses, so that I can try again.

## Design Choices

### Colour Scheme

- **Palette**: The game employs a minimalist and clean color scheme to ensure a distraction-free user experience that enhances readability and focus on gameplay.
  - **Background Color**: The background is white (`#FFFFFF`), providing a neutral and clean backdrop that allows other elements to stand out clearly.
  - **Text and Interactive Elements**: Letters and interactive elements, such as the alphabet and dashes representing the hidden word, are displayed in black (`#000000`). This high contrast ensures that the text is easily readable against the white background.
  - **Buttons**: The clickable letter buttons have a white background with black text, maintaining consistency with the overall color scheme while providing a clear indication of available and selected letters.
  - **Gallows and Hangman Figure**: The gallows and any parts of the hangman figure that appear as the game progresses are drawn in black (`#000000`), ensuring they are clearly visible and contribute to the game's aesthetic.

This color scheme was chosen to prioritize readability and simplicity, ensuring that the game is both accessible and easy to interact with for all users. The consistent use of black and white provides a timeless, classic look that is both functional and visually appealing.
